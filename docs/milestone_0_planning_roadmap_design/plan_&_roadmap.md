The current roadmap/planning is a detailed and updated version of the proposal's milestones that were published on-chain. <br>

## Milestone #0 - Preparation and planning: (February 10th, 2023 to February 17th, 2023) 
The goal for this part of the project is to identify all of the resources we will need to build the NFT marketplace, including visuals and designs for the website/application and the smart contract, as well as additional front-end and back-end development.

### Expected Resources Needed to Realize the Project
Our team consists of one front-end developer and one back-end developer, so we have sufficient resources to create the website/application interface and the Rust smart contract.<br>

We will seek assistance from external resources (1-2 individuals on a part-time or contract basis) to create graphic designs (logo, characters, etc.) and to help with the visual aspects (colors, website organization, etc.) of the NFT marketplace's application. We will also work with another person to review our front-end codebase to ensure that everything is covered. For the back-end part, we will receive support to review our codebase and to develop database functionality and features.<br>

In the subsequent sections, we outline the plan for building the NFT marketplace.

## Milestone #1 - Alpha version of the platform
**Expected start date for this milestone**: February 17th, 2023 <br>
**Expected delivery date for this milestone**: March 17th - March 31st, 2023 <br>
**Amount released for completing this milestone**: 200M $HUAHUA <br>

The primary objective of this milestone is to produce a preliminary version (alpha) of the NFT marketplace, allowing us to solicit feedback regarding the following items:
- The design of the marketplace,
- The marketplace's features,
- Related smart-contract features,
- The visuals like: logo, platform's name, character, etc. 

The users will have the opportunity to evaluate the functionalities and features of the marketplace in a test environment, thereby providing them with a more comprehensive understanding of the product.

**Specific items to be accomplished/delivered during this milestone**: <br>
- A first version of the Rust/CosmWasm smart-contract with **50%-60%** of the features mentioned in the planning section of Milestone 1
- All the associated *local environment* unit and integration tests for the smart-contract
- A first version of the React/TS application with the features corresponding to what the smart-contract is able to accomplish
- Design and start implementing the price oracle and reward (and VIP) system

The intention of gathering feedback from the community is to facilitate the creation of a product that will meet their needs and provide a positive user experience. All the feedback gathered will be listed, considered and we'll provide an answer if those require changes.

## Milestone #2 - Beta version of the platform
**Expected start date for this milestone**: March 17th - March 31st, 2023 <br>
**Expected delivery date for this milestone**: April 28th - May 5th, 2023 <br>
**Amount released for completing this milestone**: 100M $HUAHUA <br>

This version is similar to the previous one but the users will be able to try everything using NFT collections and tokens. At this point, **85%-90%** of the NFT Marketplace will be completed and it will be accessible on the $HUAHUA testnet. In order to make this testnet version easy to use, we will make a website where people can claim NFTs, trade them, etc. The objective is to provide the user with an experience that is nearly indistinguishable from the final product.

**Specific items to be accomplished during this milestone**: <br>
- Release of the Rust/CosmWasm smart contract, which is estimated to be **85% to 90%** complete. The code has undergone peer review by at least two additional individuals, and we invite everyone to examine it and provide feedback or comments.
- An improved version of the React/TS application will be released, incorporating all feedback and comments received during the previous milestone. This version will include all the features the smart contract is capable of performing.
- A mobile version of the application
- On-chain testing of the price oracle
- On-chain simulation of the trading rewards + VIP system
- All the unit and integration tests will be in the Rust repo and we'll also have simulation tests on the testnet to check the scalability to the application and contract.

Again, we will be gathering feedback and comments to improve and provide exactly what the users want. We believe that after this milestone, the users will have a very good idea of the final product as we expect it to be **85%-90%** completed.

## Milestone #3 - Beta 2 version of the platform
**Expected start date for this milestone**: April 28th - May 5th, 2023 <br>
**Expected delivery date for this milestone**: June 2nd - June 16th, 2023 <br>
**Amount released for completing this milestone**: 100M $HUAHUA <br>

During this milestone, we will release the final versions of our code-base, applications, and other relevant materials. These final versions will be accessible on both the $HUAHUA testnet and mainnet for testing purposes, to confirm that the platform meets the expectations of the community. <br>

Additionally, this milestone will include the release of features that were not entirely explained in previous phases, as the previous stage of development was only 90% complete. Our goal is to create an enjoyable platform and we believe that incorporating a gamified approach will provide a more enjoyable user experience.

**Specific items to be accomplished during this milestone**: <br>
- Release of the final Rust/CosmWasm smart contract, which has been peer-reviewed by at least two individuals. We encourage all stakeholders to review the code and provide feedback or comments.
- Release of the final version of the React/TS application, incorporating all feedback and comments received during previous milestones.
- Final mobile implementation of the application
- All the unit, integration and simulation tests will have been put in place.

In conclusion, this milestone will be used to gather final feedback from users before the official release of the product on the $HUAHUA mainnet.

## Milestone #4 - Release
**Expected start date for this milestone**: June 2nd - June 16th, 2023 <br>
**Expected delivery date for this milestone**: June 16th - June 30th, 2023 <br>
**Amount released for completing this milestone**: 100M $HUAHUA <br>

Release of the platform. Again, we'll be gathering some feedback and comments to make future improvements.

## Milestone #5 - Ongoing maintenance and improvements:
**Expected start date for this milestone**: June 16th - June 30th, 2023 <br>
**Amount released for completing this milestone**: 50M $HUAHUA <br>

Ongoing maintenance and improvements.

## Conclusion
The above roadmap is subject to change if there are any major improvements to be made to the platform. With the given timeline, we are confident to deliver the NFT marketplace in due time. We hope our roadmap makes sense for everyone we welcome any feedback and comments to improve our roadmap and align it with what the $HUAHUA community thinks would generate the most value.
