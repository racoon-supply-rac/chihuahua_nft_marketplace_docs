# Chihuahua NFT Marketplace 

Following Racoon Supply's [proposal #43](https://www.mintscan.io/chihuahua/proposals/43) on Chihuahua Chain, we will be using this GitHub repository as the centralised source of information regarding the development progress of the NFT Marketplace. <br>

## Funds distribution

The funds were received on February 8th, 2023 and we transfered to the following [$HUAHUA account](https://www.mintscan.io/chihuahua/account/chihuahua1gghk6mkzz8usqsmx5ug948e5j72z867xu9nk60). The initial funding was delegated to 15 validators to lock and decentralise the funds.
